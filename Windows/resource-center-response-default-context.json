    "description": "<p>A surprising statistic published in May, 2011, by the United States Small Business Administration was that family-owned businesses account for 90% of all businesses in the United States (large and small) [<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sba.gov\/community\/blogs\/community-blogs\/small-business-matters\/5-tips-managing-successful-family-business\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sba.gov<\/a>]. From two-person shops to the largest family businesses in the U.S., there are family dynamics and family challenges that don&#8217;t surface in day-to-day management of other businesses. A business that was founded and currently owned by a family and includes, as managers and employees, two or three generations of the family, has a different set of obstacles surfacing continually during the course of business.<\/p>\n<p>By definition, a family business is founded by an older generation and passed down to a younger generation. As simple as it sounds, the act of turning over management, succession, retirement and even absorbing new technologies and new business methods, is &#8220;dangerous change&#8221; to a family business. Change, in management and the business climate, the economy, law and regulation, can throw any business into an emergency planning mode. For the family business, change can be \u201cdangerous\u201d, as the relationships between family members, emotions, expectations, even distribution of power within the family itself, compounded by the need to change, can throw the business into a downward spiral.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most &#8220;dangerous&#8221; areas of change is a change in technology. Family businesses that have to visit customers to make pickups, deliveries, or services stops, or multi-generational businesses that have a fleet, have traditionally depended on the memories of their drivers, or their founder&#8217;s own knowledge of the area covered.\u00a0<a title=\"Vehicle and Fleet Route Planning Software\" href=\"http:\/\/www.route4me.com\/\">Vehicle and fleet route planning software<\/a>\u00a0has revolutionized the industry, making it possible to eliminate the step of perusing a map, writing a list of stops and navigating new areas of a town by word of mouth.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.route4me.com\/\">Route optimization software<\/a>, to those businesses that use it, is as crucial to business as cellular phones are to communication. Yet incorporating routing software to take the place of map-reading, for driver route planning, can be a major obstacle to overcome, in the family business. For example, a family that owns and operates a nationwide fleet (and needs fleet route planning) may have a separate set of challenges than a family-owned flower shop that has a driver making 10-15 stops per day.<\/p>\n",

    "description": "<p>Universities are studying \u201cthe family business\u201d. Fairleigh Dickinson University, in New Jersey, established the O. Berk Company Family Business Forum in 1992, to support local family businesses with breakfast presentations for members, covering such topics as \u201c Emotional Intelligence and Resolving Conflict\u201d. The focus is on exchange of ideas in a small group (20-25 member businesses), through regular meetings and personal connections, modeled much like a large family. The Forum lists a number of concerns, not usually encountered by non-family businesses:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selecting and preparing successors<\/li>\n<li>Planning for estate taxes and ownership transfer<\/li>\n<li>Fostering open and productive communications<\/li>\n<li>Managing conflict within the family and business<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>[<a href=\"http:\/\/view.fdu.edu\/default.aspx\/?id=1218\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">view.fdu.edu<\/a>]<\/p>\n<p>Theoretically, outside resources, like the Forum at Fairleigh Dickinson University, should make it easy to run a family business, rocket to the top of the heap and flourish, even in an impaired economy. After all, higher education is researching the elements of running a successful family business. However, academic studies are not so valuable outside academia. For example, a first-generation owner of a\u00a0<a title=\"Business Delivery Routing Software\" href=\"http:\/\/www.route4me.com\/\">business that makes delivery stops along routes in a large area<\/a>\u00a0may be confronted by a second-generation manager, who wants to\u00a0<a title=\"Incorporate Route Optimization Software into Your Business to Save Money\" href=\"http:\/\/www.route4me.com\/\">add route optimization software to the business for vehicle route planning<\/a>, over the objection of the owner. In the academic world, this is described as part of the communication issue, or the transition of power issue. In the real world, however, this conflict, along with other obstacles to the success of a family-owned and operated business, should be described in real world terms as below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selecting and preparing successors: When Grandfather ran the company, women were secretaries. Now who gets to make a difference in management\u2014Son who follows exactly in his father&#8217;s business model footsteps or Granddaughter, who has an M.B.A. From Harvard?<\/li>\n<li>Planning for estate taxes and ownership transfer: Taxes will always be with us, but owners can give titles with no authority.<\/li>\n<li>Fostering open and productive communications: When family members divorce and ex-spouses are still in the business\u2014then what?<\/li>\n<li>Managing conflict within the family and business: Conflict can be small, such as a difference in opinion about a project or large, such as an owner&#8217;s refusal to embrace important technology, such as\u00a0<a title=\"Route Planning Software for Family Businesses\" href=\"http:\/\/www.route4me.com\/\">route planning software<\/a>, for fear of insulting\u00a0<a title=\"Fleet Routing Software\" href=\"http:\/\/www.route4me.com\/\">fleet drivers<\/a>, who have been relying on their memories for years.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The first step to solving the problems of a family business is to describe them in real world terms.<\/p>\n",
